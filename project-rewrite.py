# How can you divide and calulate modulo without actually dividing? 
# Try to add up numbers until you reach the goal! 
# We'll test only with not too large numbers (between -100 and 100). 
# Also, reproducing integer division can be tricky; as you can read in the documentation, 
# "The result is always rounded towards minus infinity: 1//2 is 0, (-1)//2 is -1, 1//(-2) is -1, and (-1)//(-2) is 0."
